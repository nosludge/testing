# Environment Dependencies Policy

## Purpose

This policy describes how testing maintainers
consume third-party packages.

## Scope

This policy applies to all testing maintainers
and all third-party packages used in the testing
project.

## Policy

testing contributors must follow these guidelines
when consuming third-party packages:

### General

- Only use third-party packages necessary for the functionality of
  testing.
- Use maintained third-party packages with a reasonably good reputation.
- Prefer small, single-purpose packages over large, complex ones.
- Implement small functionalities within the project instead of
  using a third-party package (unless the third-party package is lightweight,
  well-maintained and has a good reputation).
- Avoid using third-party packages with known security vulnerabilities.
- Before sending changes with new dependencies, make sure all automated
  tests pass (`pre-commit` checks and continuous integration pipelines)

### Versioning

- Use package manager to manage third-party dependencies.
- Lock __all of the dependencies__ (including developer tools) before
  merging the changes.
- Specify __only__ `major` versions for all stable third-party packages
  (version `1.x.y` or above) unless `minor` or `patch` versions
  are required for compatibility or functionality.
- Specify `major`, `minor`, and `patch` versions for all pre-release
  third-party packages (version `0.x.y`).
- Use the latest `major` version of all third-party packages whenever possible.

## Procedure

When adding a new third-party package to testing,
contributors must follow these steps:

1. Is the package necessary for the functionality
  of testing?
2. How stable is the package? Is it a pre-release version (`0.x.y`) or a stable
  version (`1.x.y` or above)?
3. Research the package. Is it well-maintained? Does it have a good reputation?
4. Choose a compatible version of the package.
  Use the latest version whenever possible.
5. Update the `pyproject.toml` and lock the dependencies.

## Archived or deprecated packages

When a third-party package is discontinued, the testing
maintainers must ensure replacement of the package with a suitable alternative.

## Enforcement

This policy is enforced by the testing maintainers.
Maintainers are expected to review each other's code changes to ensure
that they comply with this policy.

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the testing
maintainers/leaders on a case-by-case basis.
