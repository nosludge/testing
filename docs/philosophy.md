# `pynudge` Philosophy

## Ethical Nudging

Encourages best practices by:

- Simplifying setup
- Reducing cognitive load (e.g., commit scope automation)
- Providing sensible defaults
- Making skipping best practices harder than following them
- Keeping explanations concise
- Automating reliably

> [!tip]
> Inspired by [nudge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory).

## Adjustable

No one-size-fits-all. `pynudge` enables customization:

- Centralized config (`pyproject.toml`)
- Forkable for custom templates
- Documented examples of adjustments provided

## Secure

Integrates `devsecops` best practices (inspired by Python, Go) if:

- No added developer burden
- Benefits greatly outweigh daily usage costs

## State-of-the-Art Practices

Follows modern best practices if:

- Derived from reliable sources
- Not overly experimental
- Aligned with core principles

> [!caution]
> Some practices may be opinionated and not fit all cases.

## Open

Transparent and community-driven; everyone can contribute, suggest changes,
and voice opinions.
