# Scheduled Jobs

`pynudge` runs scheduled jobs weekly, typically on weekends.

> [!tip]
> All cron-like jobs are in `/.github/workflows` and use the
> `on: schedule` trigger.

## Jobs

Most scheduled jobs focus on security (`security-_` workflows)
and are run periodically as vulnerabilities evolve, namely:

- __Security posture analysis:__ [`ossf/scorecard`](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard)
- __Vulnerability scanning:__ [`google/osv-scanner`](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner)
- __Bug detection & code quality:__ [`semgrep/semgrep`](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep)

## Dependency automation

Automating dependency updates ensures security and stability.

### Renovate

> [!important]
> Only relevant workflows run when `renovate` opens a PR
> (e.g., `markdown` checks for `dev-markdown` updates).

- Updates run on weekends.
- Dependencies are grouped by `dev-<type>`.
- Updates are handled by `github-actions[bot]`.

#### Adjustments

> [!caution]
> If adding a `dev` dependency in `pyproject.toml`,
> update `.github/renovate.json` accordingly.

New `dev-<type>` groups require:
- A corresponding entry in `renovate.json`.
- (Probably) a new `.github/workflows/renovate-<type>.yml` workflow.

> [!note]
> `.github/workflows/<type>-renovate.yml` should run only when the
> branch name matches `dependencies-dev-<type>`.

> [!tip]
> See the [workflows](workflows.md) section for more details.

### pre-commit

Independent `pre-commit` hooks update weekly. All hooks run against the
latest `main` branch state to ensure updates are correct.

> [!note]
> `renovate` does not update `pre-commit` hooks due to maintainers'
> policy ([details](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/pre-commit/#additional-information)).

## Content Generation

[`cog`](https://github.com/nedbat/cog) automates content generation based on source code
comments (check `DO NOT EDIT UNTIL end marker` in `pyproject.toml`).

Additionally, [`opennudge/cogeol`](https://github.com/nedbat/cog)
integrates [Pythonâ€™s end-of-life](https://endoflife.date/) data to simplify management.

Together with GitHub Actions, these ensure:

- Support for the latest three Python versions.
- CI/CD always runs appropriate versions.
- PRs are opened for new releases and scheduled deprecations.

> [!note]
> Template updates are not __currently__ automated; the workflow is a
> placeholder for future use.
