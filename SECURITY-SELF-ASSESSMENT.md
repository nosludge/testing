## Overview

Testing

### Actors

- [opennudge/pynudge](https://github.com/opennudge/pynudge) - core security templateG
from which the repository was generated

### Actions

TBD

### Goals

TBD

### Non-goals

## Self-assessment use

This self-assessment was automatically generated by the
[pynudge](https://github.com/opennudge/pynudge) template to provide
basic seucirty information about the project __and should be extended
to provide a more comprehensive view of the security posture on a
per-project basis__.

> [!important]
> It is not intended to provide a security audit of
> [`nosludge/testing`](https://github.com/nosludge/testing)
> or function as an independent assessment or attestation of its security posture.

## Security functions and features
