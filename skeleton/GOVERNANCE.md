# Governance

This document describes the roles and responsibilities of the maintainers.

## Decision process

- We welcome all contributors and maintainers,
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on __any project-related topics__.
- _{{cookiecutter.repository_owner}}_ reserves the right to make final
decisions on the project (the roadmap, features, releases,
general project direction and so on)

## Roles

- __External contributors__ - anyone who is not a maintainer (can submit PRs,
issues, and so on)
- __Maintainers__ - people who have write access to the repository (can merge
PRs, open/close issues and so on)
- __Specific roles__ (e.g. release manager, security leader) are under
the discretion of _{{cookiecutter.repository_owner}}_

## Questions

In case of specific questions, open a new discussion or contact one of the
maintainers directly.
